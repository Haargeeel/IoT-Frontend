## Installation

You need:
  * node (at least version 4.\*)
  * mongo (at least version 3.\*)

installed on your computer.

All set? Good. So on `git clone` this repo.

Make sure to install all important dependencies.

`npm install`

OK. You are almost done. We (I) are using gulp for building our files. So run:

`gulp`

Nice. Now you have all the files where they should be.

Now you can run the server with `node .`

In your browser you can visit now `localhost:3000` to see our nice project in action.
